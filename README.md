simple-single-gallery
=====================

A very simple image gallery. Just upload files and application to a web-directory and have the application resize the images and display them on a single page. Nothing more, nothing less.

Just add your photos to the photos directory, when you open the page for the first time it will take a while to load (all the thumbnails are created the first time)

There is a simple config file (ssg.conf) to change certain parameters.
